Software Craftsmanship Guild Mastery Project - Learning Management System


Create mock-up for a school's dashboard system. This system will allow parents, students, and teachers the ability to view, edit, and delete various components of a learning system. Each dashboard will be unique to the type of user and some users will not have access to the same system levels that other users have. For example: A teacher may issue an assignment and post grades but a student will not be able to. 

Essential components of the project include the ability to connect to SQL Server 2012, fully-functioning web application using Asp.net MVC, use stored procedures to support more flexible operations, and be visually appealing/easy to use. This project is the culmination of 8 weeks of intensive learning at the Software Craftsmanship Guild in Akron, OH so will include many, if not most, of the concepts we have learned. 

The "Blackboard" like application will constantly be updating. As this project is a work in progress, things will break. Feel free to leave comments with suggestions, criticisms, and other advice at any point.
